Ingredients:

1 whole fryer chicken (approximately 3 1/2 lb)
grapeseed oil or room-temperature butter (to coat)
sea salt (to taste)
freshly ground black pepper (to taste)

Step 1: Prepare the chiken
- Prepare the chicken for roasting, first preheat your oven to 400째 F (205째 C).

- Pat the chicken dry with paper towels.
Note: If you are short on roasting time, you can butterfly the chicken. This will cut the cooking time down by about 15 minutes or so.

- Lightly coat the entire surface of the chicken with oil or room-temperature butter. Next, liberally season the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper. Truss the chicken, if desired. Place the chicken breast-side up into a suitable-sized, heavy-bottomed roasting pan or fry pan.


Step 2: Roasting the Chicken
- Roasting the Chicken

- Place the chicken onto the middle rack in the oven and roast for approximately 30 minutes.

- After 30 minutes, check the chicken and turn, if necessary, to obtain even color. Baste the chicken with the rendered fat.

- Continue to roast the chicken for 15 to 30 minutes before testing for doneness. A thermometer, when inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, should reach 165째 F (or 74째 C). If not, continue to cook until it reaches this temperature.


Step 3: Resting, Carving and Serving the Chicken
- Resting, Carving and Serving the Chicken

- Once done, remove the chicken from the pan and place onto a rack. Cover with a vented piece of foil and let rest for 10 to 15 minutes.

- Skim off the excess fat from the pan. Once the chicken has rested, carve and return it to the pan to soak up the remaining juices. Serve family style.
